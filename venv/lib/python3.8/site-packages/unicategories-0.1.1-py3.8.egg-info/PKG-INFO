Description: # unicategories
        
        Unicode category database, generated and cached on setup.
        
        This module exposes a category dictionary containing `RangeGroup` instances,
        containing all unicode category character ranges detected on your system.
        
        ## Example
        
        ```python
        from unicategories import categories
        
        upperchars = categories['Lu'].characters()  # iterator
        print('Unicode uppercase caracters are "%s"' % ''.join(upperchars))
        # Unicode uppercase caracters are "ABCDEF..."
        ```
        
        ## RangeGroup
        
        Immutable iterable (based on tuple, with some useful methods) of (start, end)
        tuples being, like python's `range`, open at the end.
        
        This method have been chosen for memory efficiency, storing individually all
        characters on memory would take a lot of memory.
        
        RangeGroup class provides the following methods:
        
        ### `range_group.characters()`
        `type: () -> typing.Iterator[str]`
        ```rst
        Get iterator with all characters on this range group.
        
        :returns: iterator of characters (str of size 1)
        ```
        
        ### `range_group.codes()`
        `type: () -> typing.Iterator[int]`
        ```rst
        Get iterator for all unicode code points contained in this range group.
        
        :returns: iterator of character indexes (int)
        ```
        
        ### `range_group.has(character)`
        `type: (typing.Union[str, int]) -> bool`
        ```rst
        Get if character (or character code point) is part of this range group.
        
        :param character: character or unicode code point to look for
        :returns: True if character is contained by any range, False otherwise
        ```

        In addition to that, unicategories provide general categories `L`, `M`, `N`, `P`, `S`, `Z` and `C`.
